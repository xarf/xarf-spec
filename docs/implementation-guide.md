### Parser Integration Patterns

**Email-Based Integration:**
```python
def process_abuse_email(email_message):
    # Extract XARF attachment
    xarf_data = extract_xarf_attachment(email_message)
    
    # Parse with automatic v3/v4 detection
    report = xarf_parser.parse(xarf_data)
    
    # Route based on class and type
    if report.class == 'messaging' and report.type == 'spam':
        route_to_spam_team(report)
    elif report.class == 'content' and report.type == 'phishing':
        route_to_takedown_team(report)
    
    # Create ticket with structured data
    ticket = create_ticket(
        title=f"{report.class.title()} abuse from {report.source_identifier}",
        description=format_report_summary(report),
        evidence=report.evidence,
        priority=calculate_priority(report)
    )
```

**API-Based Integration:**
```javascript
// Express.js webhook endpoint
app.post('/xarf/reports', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Parse incoming XARF report
    const report = await xarfParser.parse(req.body);
    
    // Validate and enrich
    await validateReport(report);
    const enrichedReport = await enrichWithThreatIntel(report);
    
    // Process based on class
    switch (report.class) {
      case 'connection':
        await handleNetworkAttack(enrichedReport);
        break;
      case 'infrastructure':
        await handleInfrastructureCompromise(enrichedReport);
        break;
      default:
        await handleGenericAbuse(enrichedReport);
    }
    
    res.json({ status: 'processed', report_id: report.report_id });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

**Streaming Integration:**
```go
func processXARFStream(stream chan []byte) {
    for data := range stream {
        // Parse XARF report with error handling
        report, err := xarfparser.Parse(data)
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("Parse error: %v", err)
            continue
        }
        
        // Filter and route based on criteria
        if shouldProcess(report) {
            go processReportAsync(report)
        }
        
        // Update metrics
        metrics.ReportsProcessed.Inc()
        metrics.ReportsByClass.WithLabelValues(report.Class).Inc()
    }
}
```

### Error Handling Best Practices

**Graceful Degradation:**
```python
def parse_xarf_report(data):
    try:
        # Attempt v4 parsing
        return xarf_parser.parse_v4(data)
    except ValidationError as e:
        if is_v3_format(data):
            # Fallback to v3 parsing with conversion
            return xarf_parser.parse_v3_and_convert(data)
        else:
            # Log error but continue processing
            log_validation_error(e, data)
            return create_manual_review_ticket(data)
    except Exception as e:
        # Critical error - alert operations team
        alert_operations(f"XARF parsing failed: {e}")
        raise
```

**Monitoring and Alerting:**
```yaml
# Prometheus metrics configuration
metrics:
  - name: xarf_reports_processed_total
    type: counter
    labels: [class, type, source]
  - name: xarf_parsing_errors_total
    type: counter
    labels: [error_type, version]
  - name: xarf_processing_duration_seconds
    type: histogram
    buckets: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0]

alerts:
  - name: XARFParsingFailureRate
    condition: rate(xarf_parsing_errors_total[5m]) > 0.1
    severity: warning
  - name: XARFProcessingLatency
